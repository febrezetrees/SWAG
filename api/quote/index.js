//define an async function which calls our URL using the HTTP module 'get' method

//With modern Promise-based functions, we attach our callback functions to the returned promises instead, forming a promise chain. As the name suggests, a promise is either kept or broken. So, a promise is either completed(kept) or rejected(broken).

//state of a pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error)

//function expression:
async function getImage() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    https.get(unplashApi, (res) => {
      //https.get(URL, response)
      // API returns a HTTP 302 code, we only want the final image URL
      resolve(res.headers.location); // Promise.resolve method = Argument to be resolved by this Promise. Returns a Promise that is resolved.
    }).on('error', (error) => {
      reject(error.message); // Promise.reject method = returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason.
    });
  });

/*The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
The methods Promise.prototype.then(), Promise.prototype.catch(), and Promise.prototype.finally() are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes settled. As the Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises, they can be chained.
The .then() method takes up to two arguments; the first argument is a callback function for the fulfilled case of the promise, and the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case. Each .then() returns a newly generated promise object, which can optionally be used for chaining */


//Azure javascript functions must be exported via "module.exports" (a Node concept)

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  //The first argument passed to every function is a context object, which is used for receiving and sending binding data, logging, and communicating with the runtime.
  //access the req and res objects on the context object:
  context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

  context.res = {
    body: {
      image,

  };
};

//The exported function completes when the exported async function/Promise completes.
//By default, the Functions runtime looks for your function in index.js,
//When exporting an async function, you can also configure an output binding to take the return value. This is recommended if you only have one output binding.
